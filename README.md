*WinAuth is a portable, open-source Authenticator for Windows that provides counter or time-based RFC 6238 authenticators and common implementations, such as the Google Authenticator. This fork disables functionality undesired for corporate use like the gaming options and enforced several security measures that are optionl in the original software.*
